# Integral Calculator
A C++ program that calculates an integral using the trapezoid method, and then using Simpson's 1/3 rule.

The program takes in 3 inputs:
 - Start of Range (double)
 - End of Range (double)
 - Number of sections (int)

The program will then output a value using the function `f(x) = x^2 + 1`, which it is integrating on.

This assignment was originally created by Dr. Leslie Kerby, Idaho State University.
